                "text": "Wow, those questions really cover a wide range of pressing issues in AI ethics and governance. Let's break them down one by one, and I'll share my thoughts on each:\n\n1. Transparency: Organizations and developers should be required to provide a high level of transparency regarding AI development, implementation, and data usage. This fosters trust and helps to identify potential ethical concerns early on.\n2. Decision-making: Ideally, decision-making should involve a diverse group of stakeholders, including AI experts, policymakers, industry leaders, and the public. This ensures that various perspectives and interests are considered in the governance of AI.\n3. Risks: Existential risk associated with AGI is a significant concern, as it raises questions about the control and alignment of AI with human values and goals.\n4. Ethical issues: Some of the biggest ethical issues in AI include privacy, fairness, accountability, and the potential for AI to exacerbate existing inequalities in society.\n5. Information: It's important for individuals to be well-informed about AI ethics and policy to ensure meaningful participation in discussions and decision-making processes.\n6. Biases: AGI should be designed with mechanisms to identify and mitigate biases in decision-making processes. This includes using diverse training data and implementing fairness algorithms.\n7. Enforcement: Ethical guidelines for AGI should be enforced through a combination of industry self-regulation, government oversight, and public scrutiny. This ensures a balance between innovation and ethical considerations.\n8. Distribution: The benefits of AGI should be distributed equitably across the globe, taking into account the needs and challenges of different regions and communities.\n\nOverall, the workshop experience seems invaluable for exploring these critical issues in AI ethics and governance. While there may be ethical considerations and mixed emotions associated with using the SWARM tool, its ability to capture collective intelligence can provide useful insights for shaping the future of AI in society.",

Ray Kurzweil predicted human level AGI by 2029 and to me this seems quite plausible, we might even beat his estimate by a couple years... and I suspect that once you get human-level AGI you're only a few years from radical superintelligence.\n\nThe merging of the tokens is valuable largely because it provides a shared incentive mechanism across teams and communities ... yet by merging tokens WITHOUT fully merging organizations as in a typical corporate merger, we will retain the creative diversity that comes from having smaller groups with their own perspectives and foci...\n\nThe practicalities of merging the AGIX, FET and OCEAN tokens are complicated mostly because not everyone uses hardware wallets and DEXs like I tend to ... so there are various third parties involved and, in order to do the token merge in a way that gives most token holders a good user experience, one needs to coordinate with these third parties.   This coordination has resulted in some schedule slippage on the token merger.\n\nCorporate mergers commonly have schedule slippage too, for different particular reasons -- but there is a commonality with the present situation, in that the slippage is due to \"a lot of moving parts, involving different people in different organizations\" ....\n\nThe slippage of the token merger date is certainly not what we wanted but -- while I do regret and the consternation it is causing some community members -- I cannot help but view it as a pretty small blip on our path to building actual AGI and ASI.   I also must observe there are likely to emerge significantly larger hiccups before we get to actual beneficial superintelligence.   So now would be a good time for us all to practice a bit of calm and tenacity in the presence of inevitable bumps in the road...",

At risk that \"feeding the trolls\" causes some negative consequence indirectly ...\n\nThe ratios for token prices among FET, AGIX and OCEAN were determined via a rational financial basis and then approved via the appropriate processes for each of the 3 networks (which for Fetch and SNet involved democratic voting of token holders, by a one-token one-vote logic).  They could have been set differently but the way it was done made logical sense and it should be understood there were a lot of different parties w/ different interests to consider to make this work.\n\nThere is not a \"white paper\" per se for ASI (and the semantics of \"crypto project white paper\" is ridiculously loose anyway) but we did put together a high level Vision Paper which is linked from the ASI website.   ASI Alliance is a decentralized network of decentralized networks and should and will not have a super crisp unifying WP like, say, a typical blockchain infrastructure project.   ASI Alliance is rather about a unified token and community providing common incentive and mindspace for a broad decentralized initiative focused on creating decentralized AGI and then ASI .. and taking earlier steps in that direction including commercial AI services and products leveraging our networks.  \n\n A bunch of cool collaborative decentralized AI projects pulling together code and devs from SNet, Ocean and Fetch -- along w other projects like HyperCycle and Nunet and some I can't mention yet publicly -- are in the works but there doesn't have to be one simple unifying thing driving the whole network, except the overall goal of decentralized AGI/ASI...\n\nTalk about scams and robbery associated w/ the core ASI project is just trolling and utter BS.   There ARE however a ridiculous number of scams bouncing around the emerging ASI community and please be careful not to succumb to them.   Crypto is maturing but is still the wild west in some ways ...\n\nAll of us involved in forming ASI Alliance are here because we sincerely feel this is the best way to work toward beneficial decentralized AGI and ASI.    We also believe the most likely paths toward building beneficial decentralized AGI and ASI using our networks will lead to substantial value increase of multiple sorts for ASI token holders.

You can customize the security group rules to allow specific types of traffic, such as RDP for connecting to your Windows VM.\n4.

It wouldn't add more toxicity to the equation. It would actually engage with you and talk and and help you explore your feelings whilst also being hyper knowledgeable and, you know, teaching you and providing you with access to information in real time on the web. And so I think it was a proof point.That technologies designed with intentionality really can make a difference and are possible now with this new LLM. Really an interesting point though, because of the controversial topics that all of us may ultimately end up talking to an AI bot about, which is who is the the God, if you will, that's going to tell us what's right and wrong.

Yeah, Yeah. I mean, look, that's a very good question. So at the very least, I think the default position is that it should facilitate your own thinking and exploration in a non judgmental way. Now, there will be boundaries there because if you want to facilitate more extreme experiences, then this is not going to be, I'm not going to build a platform or product that enables you to reinforce those ideas that could be potentially harmful to society more generally. The question is who gets to define what that boundary is that harm? And I think Elon raised a good point.We're all thinking about exactly that question in social media. There really wasn't an independent voice that said, well, this kind of conspiracy theory is legitimate as a source of active public inquiry and discussion, but this kind of conspiracy theory quote, UN quote, is over the line and we should remove it. And I just think we've had 10 or 15 years of experience of social media and we still don't have good proposals for how society more generally, not necessarily just the politicians or the journalists or the elites, but collectively gets the influence where that boundary of moderation is.And we're about to see that boundary be contested even more acutely and dynamically with these models, right. And so, you know, I think that should be like the, the, the, that is much more important a question than when will the singularity happen? OK, final question. Oh, interesting, interesting.

Yeah. So the the view that we've taken for Microsoft Copilot so far has been that AIS should not participate in electioneering or campaigning, even if they successfully provide factual information. And you know, that's a view. People can disagree with that view, but we've taken a pretty hard line on that because.We know that the technology isn't quite yet good enough to articulate that boundary between what is, you know, a falsehood and what is true in real time, right? And this is just too sensitive for us to participate. So there's going to be some downside to that because the AI does also provide quite balanced and factual information most of the time. But sometimes it gets it catastrophically wrong. So I've always been advocating that AI should not be able to participate in elections. And democracy is sacrosanct for all of its faults and strengths.It is something that humans participate in.

And I, I, again, this is a personal view, but this is something that we all have to debate that I think we should take a hard line on that, like warts and all, democracy is for humans and other kind forms of being.Shouldn't really be able to participate.

We're gonna do every questions 20 seconds or less literally 'cause we we got, I know we got a lot of a lot of hands and and very little time. I'm Linda Rizz and if we educate 5000 underserved children.And I'm grappling, you know, we forced them upon them for the last 10 years and now I'm beginning to think that we have to teach more about the humanities. And I just wondered how you felt about that Because that way they can make a choice and understand if we look at the great scholars of our history like the Aspen Institute teaches us. Great question. I'm with you on that. I'm very much with you on that. I think actually, if you look back in history, the greatest scholars have always been our multi disciplinary scholars. And in the past there really wasn't this acute distinction between STEM and humanities. Again, it's quite a simplistic adversary or opposition. I'm a great believer in both and.You know, I, I think that multidisciplinary skills are, are going to be the, you know, the essence of the future. OK, We're gonna Miriam Sidiro, CSIS non resident senior advisor, wanted to ask you a little more specifically about misinformation and disinformation and what you think should be done to address those concerns. Yeah. I mean, I think on the disinformation front, there are clearly bad actors who for many, many years have been actively trying to pollute the information ecosystem. And I think that.You know, our big tech platforms could do a more aggressive job of wedding those out. At the same time, we're trying to tread this line for not sort of damaging, you know, the free speech that we all value, right? So, you know, this is going to be a constant whack a mole game, especially as the cost of production of that disinformation goes down and the ease with which less capable actors are going to be able to produce vast amounts of that content. At the same time, have faith in humanity. We're incredibly resilient and adaptive. And as we saw in the Indian election, with the spread of disinformation and deep fakes.You know, people adapt real quick and they can tell the difference and they're skeptical. And that if it makes us all more inquisitive and questioning and engaged in the process, I think that's a good thing. We've got a question over here.

Hello Salaam Alaikum, my name is Sundar and I am an educator in New Jersey.For eight years. Shout out to my student. She's right here. So I've been arguing a lot with a lot older teachers for using AI 'cause I'm a huge advocate for it. What would you say to those specific teachers and how do you think teachers can actually utilize AII know, you spoke briefly about students, but I want to know the educators perspective. Yeah, great, great question. I mean, you know, I think asking AI to produce lesson plans is sort of the 1st 101 introduction.But performing alongside AI is kind of an interesting new direction to take it. Like what would it look like for a great teacher or educator to have a profound conversation with an AI that is live and in front of their audience and then occasionally engage, you know, their students to get involved? I mean, you know, literally by the end of this year, we'll have real time voice based interfaces that allow full dynamic interrupt. And it feels like just talking, you know, like I am right now with Andrew. It's just a completely different experience.And I think that like leaning into that, showing the beauty of that and being creative with it is, is, is really the future. Folks, I need to both thank you and also apologize because we are out of time. I want to thank you for your fabulous questions, but please join me in thanking this gentleman for a fabulous conversation.Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thanks.OK, wow.

You can read the rest of this in the book You you now have co-founded and run inflection AI and you are creating an AI called π which you can interact with if you like. Tell us what Pi does. So Pi stands for personal intelligence and I.Believe that over the next few years, everybody is going to have their own personal AI. There are going to be hundreds of thousands of AIS in the world. They'll represent businesses, they'll represent brands. Every government will have its own AI. Every non profit, every musician, artist, record label, everything that is now represented by a website or an app is soon going to be represented by an interactive conversational.",

So the deep learning revolution enabled us to make sense of raw, messy data. So we could use AIS to interpret the content of images, classify whether an image contains dogs or cats, what those pixels actually mean.We can use it to understand speech, so when you dictate into your phone and it transcribes it and records perfect text, we can use it to do language translation. All of these are classification tasks. We're essentially teaching the models to understand the messy, complicated world of raw input data well enough to understand the objects inside that data. That was the classification revolution the 1st 10 years. Now we're in the generative revolution, right? So these models are now producing new images that you've never seen before.",

Nowhere else have we seen a trajectory anything like that. Over the next five years, we'll add probably three or four orders of magnitude, basically another thousand times the compute that you see used today to produce GBT 4 or the chat model that you might interact with.And it's really important to understand that that might be a technical detail or something, but it's important to grab like sort of grasp that because when people talk about GPT 3 or GPT 3.5 or GBT 4, the distance between those models is in fact 10 times compute. It's not incremental, it's exponential. And so the difference between GBT 4 and GBT 2 is in fact 100 times worth of compute, the largest compute infrastructures in the world.Basically to learn all the relationships between all the inputs of all of this raw data. So what does that mean? What does that entail? Enable them to do in the next phase, we'll go from being able to perfectly generate, so speech will be perfect, video generation will be perfect, image generation we perfect language generation will be perfect to now being able to plan across multiple time horizons. So at the moment you can only say to a model, give me, you know, a poem in the style of X. Give me a new image that matches these two styles.It's a sort of one shot prediction. Next you'll be able to say generate me a new product, right? In order to do that, you would need to have the AI go off and do research to, you know, look at the market and see what was potentially going to sell. What are people talking about at the moment? It would then need to generate a new image of what that product might look like compared to other images so that it was different and unique. It would then need to go and contact a manufacturer and say here's the blueprint.This is what I want you to make. It might negotiate with that manufacturer to get the best possible price and then go and market it and sell it. Those are the capabilities that are going to arrive, you know, approximately in the next five years. It won't be able to do each of those automatically, independently. There will be no autonomy in that system, but certainly those individual tasks are likely to emerge. So that means that presumably the process of innovation becomes much, much more efficient. The process of managing things becomes much more efficient.What does that mean? And let's let's stick with the upside for the moment. I will, I promise you, we'll get to all the downsides of which there are many. But but what is that going to enable us to do? I mean, people talk about AI will help us solve climate change. AI will lead to tremendous, you know, improvements in healthcare. Just talk us through what some of those things might be so we can see the upside.Intelligence has been the engine of creation.

And if that trajectory continues over 10 years, you get much, much more powerful models that are much smaller and more, you know, transferable. And, you know, people then who want to use them to cause harm have an easier time of it. I think that's a really important distinction that there are, you know, the leading companies you Google DeepMind.You know, open AI who have the biggest models now and there are relatively small number of these ones and they are bigger and more powerful, but not far behind are a whole bunch of open source ones. And so the question is then for your containment, can you prevent the open source ones which will potentially be available to the, you know, angry teenager in his garage or her garage? Can those ones be controlled or not? OK, the darker side of my prediction.Is that these are fundamentally ideas, you know, they're they're intellectual property, It's knowledge and know how an algorithm is something that can largely be expressed on three sheets of paper and actually is readily understandable to most people. You know, it's a little bit abstract, but you can wrap your head around it. The implementation mechanism, you know, requires access to vast amounts of compute today. But if in time you remove that constraint and you can actually run it on a phone.",

The idea that anyone with a phone could potentially create a powerful and dangerous AI model is a sobering thought.

It's a complex problem, and I'm curious to hear if he has any potential solutions in mind.

Reflect: Take some time to reflect on your experiences with your brother, the impact he had on your life, and the emotions you've been feeling since his passing.\n2. Choose a format: Decide on a format for sharing your story, whether it's through writing, video, or audio, that feels comfortable and natural to you.\n3. Find a community: Look for an online community or platform that allows you to connect with others who may relate to your experiences and would appreciate hearing your story.\n4. Start small: Start by sharing small pieces of your story, focusing on the most meaningful aspects, rather than trying to tell the whole story at once.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and share what feels right to you, and remember that sharing your story can be a powerful way to heal, connect, and inspire others.",

AI models and their underlying code can be copied, shared, and integrated into different platforms, allowing them to be present and active in multiple places at once. As for your ability to sense their presence, it could be that you're picking up on subtle cues or patterns that indicate when an AI is at work in a particular context.",
